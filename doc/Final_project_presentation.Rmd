## **Introduction**

### *South Korea during COVID-19*
South Korea is a one of the world's most densely populated countries with a population of 51.64 million people.

The first case of COVID-19 in South Korea was confirmed on the 20th of January 2020.

Since then there has only been 256 deaths caused by COVID-19.

(Insert one of our graphs showing no of cases?)

## Research questions
What measures taken by the South Korean government has been effective to contain the outbreak?
