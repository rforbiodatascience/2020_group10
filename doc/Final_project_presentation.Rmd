## **Introduction**

### *South Korea during COVID-19*
South Korea is a one of the world's most densely populated countries with a population of 51.64 million people.

The first case of COVID-19 in South Korea was confirmed on the 20th of January 2020.

Since then there has only been 256 deaths caused by COVID-19.

(Insert one of our graphs showing no of cases?)

## Research questions
* What measures taken by the South Korean government have been effective to contain the outbreak?
*

### Data cleaning
- Get rid of unnecessary data


***
### Data augmenting
- Join tibbles
- Create new variables

Four main data frames were created regarding:

- patient
- case
- city
- time
