## **Introduction**

### *South Korea during COVID-19*
South Korea is one of the world's most densely populated countries with 51.64 million people.

The first case of COVID-19 in this country was confirmed on the 20th of January 2020. Since then, there has only been 256 deaths caused by COVID-19.


## Research questions
* Have the measures taken by the South Korean government been effective to contain the outbreak?

* Is there any correlation between the place of infection and severity of the disease?

* Does gender or age predispose for getting the disease or for a more severe outcome?

* Is it possible to predict the outcome of the infection?

* Are there any characteristic features in the high-prevalence disease areas?

* Can a prediction of the disease confirmation be made based on city features?

* Can the epidemic be traced in the South Korea searchtrends?

***

### Data cleaning
- Get rid of unnecessary data
- Remove non valid data
- Converting data into a tidy format

* filter(), mutate ()


***
### Data augmenting

- Join tibbles
- Create new variables
- Transform
- Subset the data

* full_join(), mutate(), unite ()

***
Four main data frames were created regarding:

<div class="green">
- patient (patient_info_df + patient_route_df)
</div>
<div class="red">
- case
</div>
<div class="yellow">
- city
</div>
<div class="blue">
- time (time_df, time_age_df, time_province_df)
</div>
<div class="grey">
- serchtrend
</div>

SeoulFloating and Weather were not used

Problem: our data set repeats the same name for come columns.

Solution: added a prefix

## Conclusion and discussion 


## Problems and solutions

Using different packages will mask some functions.
 
 - detach packages after each R cript.
